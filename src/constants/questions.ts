    excerpt: "Can (and maybe should) my coroutine promise class MyCoroutine::Promise have static or non-static initial_suspend and final_suspend methods?",
    content: "Can (and maybe should) my coroutine promise class `MyCoroutine::Promise` have **static** or **non-static** `initial_suspend` and `final_suspend` methods?\n\n```cpp\nstatic std::suspend_always initial_suspend() noexcept\n{\n    return {};\n}\n\nstatic std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept  \n{\n    return {};\n}\n```\n\nWhile this works fine (tested with GCC 13), Clang-Tidy complains \"Static member accessed through instance\", when using this coroutine type:\n\n```cpp\nMyCoroutine foo() // Clang-Tidy warning here\n{\n    co_return;\n}\n```\n\nThis makes sense because \"when a coroutine begins execution, it [...] calls `promise.initial_suspend()` \" (see [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines.html)) via instance, not via promise type.\n\nSo should I remove the `static` keyword from these methods (and make them `const`)? A `this` pointer is not required, but probably the compiler can optimize these calls, anyway. Or are static methods a good idea here and is there a better way to deal with this warning?\n\nSome of the examples from [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines.html) do have static `initial_suspend` and `final_suspend` methods, some don't.",

Sorting is **O(n*log(n))**, whereas partitioning is just linear. Basically it is just one run of the quick sort partitioning step with the pivot chosen to be 128.",

Non-`static`, non-`virtual` members don't have any inherent limitations to compiler-based optimizations compared to `static` ones. If the function definitions are in the header/module interface, then the compiler can inline them or otherwise do definition-based optimizations regardless of whether they're `static` or not.",
